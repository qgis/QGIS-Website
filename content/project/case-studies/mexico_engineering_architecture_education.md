## Context
We developed intensive one-week master classes in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to provide students of Civil Engineering and Architecture with functional knowledge of this advanced Information Technology tool. These classes were implemented as part of the Surveying and Highway Engineering General Courses, as well as for Architecture students within the **Sustainable Development** course. Each class is standalone, yet complementary, ensuring students gain practical knowledge regardless of which course they take.

For Architecture, the Sustainable Development course uses GIS as a tool to access and publish georeferenced information, allowing students to carry out **integral preliminary analyses** for any future project. This exposes them to large spatial databases and helps them integrate spatial data into their project planning and design workflow.

## Objectives
- Introduce GIS concepts to engineering and architecture students.  
- Democratize access to GIS by using open-source tools (QGIS).  
- Enhance students' understanding of coordinate systems, spatial databases, and data management.  
- Complement, not replace, commercial software such as AutoCAD or BIM tools.  
- Equip Architecture students with tools to access and publish georeferenced information for sustainable development projects.  

## Workflow
### Surveying
- GIS used as a platform for managing geographic information.  
- Students learned to integrate GIS into site analysis, survey data management, and preliminary studies.

### Highway Engineering
- GIS provided access to large spatial databases for infrastructure planning.  
- Students analyzed terrain, road alignment, and environmental factors to inform project planning.  

### Architecture (Sustainable Development)
- GIS introduced as a tool to access and publish georeferenced information.  
- Students applied GIS to carry out **integral preliminary analyses** for design and planning of future projects.  
- Emphasis on linking large spatial databases to sustainable development objectives.

## Results
- Students successfully completed risk maps, spatial analysis tasks, and project simulations.  
- Mastery of GIS fundamentals enabled faster progress in standard course material.  
- Improved capacity to integrate GIS into professional workflows, preparing them for BIM/CIM adoption.  
- Architecture students gained skills to leverage geospatial data for sustainable and informed project planning.

## Conclusion
QGIS proved to be a high-impact, low-cost educational tool, strengthening the understanding of spatial data management for engineering and architecture students. The implementation of this model demonstrates the potential of open-source GIS in formal education and paves the way for broader adoption in professional practice, including sustainable development initiatives.
