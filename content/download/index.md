## Before download starts

Our software is, and always will be, available free of charge if downloaded from QGIS.org.

The project is a result of a huge effort and social contribution from many community members who volunteer their time and expertise. In addition, many businesses, government agencies and commercial entities have contributed to the development of QGIS. They do this either to ensure that QGIS meets their specific needs or to contribute to and accelerate the huge social impact that is realised by making a tool such as QGIS freely available. Our goal is the betterment of society through informed spatial decision making. If you are able, we gently request that you support our work.

Whether you choose to donate or not, we hope that you enjoy using our labour of love and encourage you to share and spread your downloaded copy far and wide so that others may enjoy it too.

Our very best regards!

#### QGIS versions for macOS notice
The QGIS installers for macOS are currently **outdated** and do not reflect the latest version of QGIS. If you need newer features or fixes, please consider installing QGIS via [MacPorts]({{< ref "resources/installation-guide/#macports" >}}).  We are working on new, solid macOS builds for QGIS 4. If you wish to be an early beta tester, you can test a preview build at [this repository](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-notarize). This package will become an official, OSGEO signed package as of QGIS 4.0.

Alternatively, for native support of both Intel x86 and Apple ARM architectures, together with the latest versions of key components (e.g. GDAL, PDAL, GRASS GIS) see [MacPorts Installing Instructions]({{< ref "resources/installation-guide/#macports" >}})

##### Tips for first launch
After installing QGIS, the first launch attempt may fail due to Apple's security framework. 

**For macOS Sonoma (14) and earlier:** To enable QGIS, **control-click** (hold the control key and click) on its icon in your Applications folder and select ***Open*** in the context menu. A confirmation dialog will display where you need to click the ***Open*** button again. This only has to be done once.

**For macOS Sequoia (15) and newer:** To enable QGIS, **control-click** (hold the control key and click) its icon in your Applications folder and select ***Open*** from the context menu. A warning dialog will appear; click the ***Done*** button. Next, navigate to ***System Settings > Privacy & Security*** and scroll to the ***Security*** section. You should see a message stating that ***"QGIS" was blocked to protect your Mac***. Click ***Open Anyway***. A confirmation dialog will appear; click ***Open Anyway*** again. This only has to be done once.
