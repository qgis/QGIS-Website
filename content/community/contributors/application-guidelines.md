{{< rich-content-start themeClass="coloring-2" >}}

**DO:**
- Be specific about your contributions
- Mention concrete outcomes or metrics when possible
- Highlight ongoing or sustained efforts
- Include relevant links or references

Example: **"Coordinated monthly QGIS meetups in Berlin since 2022 with 20-40 attendees. Organized the 2024 QGIS User Conference Germany with 150+ participants. Maintain German QGIS documentation translations."**

**DON'T:**
- Be vague or generic
- Exaggerate your contributions
- Include work that's already recognized via code commits
- Exceed the 500 character limit
