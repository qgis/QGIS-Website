## Contributor Meeting

Right after the conference, QGIS Contributor Meeting will take place on 4-7 June at a next door venue. This event
is for those who contribute to the development of QGIS. It’s free to join but you are expected to make yourself useful
on improving the QGIS application, documentation or website or do anything else QGIS will benefit from.

<!-- See Contributor Meeting details on GitHub.-->

## Local Committee

The event is organized by the [Swedish QGIS user group](https://qgis.se/) with support from the [QGIS project](https://qgis.org/).
