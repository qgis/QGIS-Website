# Sustaining membership program

QGIS is an Open Source project. QGIS development, its documentation, web sites and infrastructure are largely carried out by volunteers. Since the project's inception in 2002, we have built up a large, valuable and useful code base, free for everybody to use and improve. 

We provide free access to the QGIS source code and binaries on our web site. Despite the huge achievements made via this volunteer approach, further funding is needed to support our work.

## How funds are used

Here are some of the things we use the funds we receive for:

* paying developers to fix bugs
* our annual grant programme that pays for substantial improvements to the QGIS project
* hosting fees for our server infrastructure
* improvements to upstream libraries that QGIS depends on, 
* a full time web infrastructure maintainer
* a full time documentation writer

In the future we hope to expand these activities as funding allows.

Sustaining memberships last one year, after which they may be continued with a new payment, or allowed to lapse. Sustaining memberships do not include voting rights. Existing voting rights remain unaffected.

Membership fees are approved or changed by the QGIS general assembly. They are defined as minimum fees per category, but the sustaining member may choose to pay more than the minimum if they wish.

Because QGIS.ORG is a global project and different companies, NGOs or governmental organizations have different financial means, we do not mandate membership levels. Sustaining members self-select whichever level they are able to afford.

Acceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board, who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.


## Sustaining membership benefits

#### Keep QGIS Ad Free

Sustaining memberships help to ensure we do not need to employ 'user hostile' tactics, such as advertising, to fund the project.

The decision on how funds are spent will be made by the QGIS Project Steering Committee, proposed in a budget that will be approved or declined by the QGIS.ORG general assembly.

##### About ‘earmarked’ funding
We regret that we do not accept ‘earmarked’ funding as it creates many administrative issues. If you are interested in funding specific aspects of QGIS development, we encourage you to allocate additional human resources to the project, e.g. hiring a developer, or participating in our bug fixing initiative.

{{< rich-content-start themeClass="coloring-6" >}}
##### Warning
Acceptance of sustaining membership applications is at the discretion of the QGIS PSC. We reserve the right to decline offers of sustaining members if the membership organisation or party seems to be at odds with the ethos of our project. For example offers from marketing companies that have nothing to do with GIS / spatial services, or offers where we have reason to believe the presence of the sustaining member logo and marketing materials on our site and other materials will degrade the experience of our users will be declined.
