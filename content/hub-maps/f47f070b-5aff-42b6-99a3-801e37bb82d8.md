title: "Great Meteor Sea Mountain"
description: "Map of the Great Meteor, a Sea Mountain with ~4000m high, nearby the Azores Island.\r\nThe Layout template is from the Layout Loader Plugin\r\n\r\nThe major exercise of this map was the ability to put bathymetic contours labels following a line from an helper layer called labels, instead of randomly place along the contours.\r\n\r\nThis was the expression used on the labels placement geometry generator.\r\n\r\n    coalesce(\r\n\taggregate(\r\n\t\t'labels', -- layer\r\n\t\t'collect', -- aggregate type\r\n\t\tintersection(\r\n\t\t\tbuffer($geometry,3000),\r\n\t\t\tgeometry(@parent)\r\n\t\t), -- Expression\r\n\t\tintersects(\r\n\t\t\t$geometry,\r\n\t\t\tgeometry(@parent)\r\n\t\t) -- Filter\r\n\t),\r\n\t$geometry\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nData: GEBCO (https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/)"
