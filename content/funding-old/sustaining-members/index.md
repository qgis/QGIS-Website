QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out
largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, valuable
and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. As a result, you
have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide on our web
site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks, less
interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left behind. In
addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses and
conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very
expensive for volunteer developers.

Many organizations have made an investment in using QGIS as part of
their operations, but have not had a way to directly contribute to the success
and long-term health sustainability of the QGIS project.

We would like to extend our activities and work continually to improve the quality of QGIS. Your
financial contribution will support the maintenance, improvement, and promotion
of QGIS. Becoming a sustaining member is a way of ensuring the longevity and
overall health of the project.

With your financial contributions we are able to:

{{< box-start >}}

* keep the QGIS.ORG IT infrastructure up and running. This includes aspects, such as:
  
  * the QGIS.ORG website and related infrastructure
  * our issue (bug and feature reporting) system
  * the continuous integration system that tests each change or pull request against
    a series of automated unit tests
  * our documentation and API documentation system

* packaging QGIS for various operating systems
* fixing bugs and other issues
* managing pull requests and do code reviewing
* mentoring new contributors
* translating QGIS
* running our QGIS grant system that allows contributors to work on behind the scenes
  improvements to the QGIS code base, our infrastructure, documentation or other aspects
  of our community. Work that otherwise would be hard to do by volunteers only or hard
  to sell to customers of QGIS development companies
* organize and support our contributor meetings and QGIS conferences

QGIS.ORG is to be transparent with the funds we receive and how we spend them. For more information,
consult the financial reports and budgets.

Sustaining members can support QGIS for any amount of money at or above 500 € per year.
Sustaining memberships last one year, after which they may be continued with a new
payment, or allowed to lapse. 

Euros  | Membership level
-------|-------------------
27,000+ | Flagship Member (e.g. for companies larger than 100 employees, federal governmental organizations)
9,000+  | Large Member (e.g. for larger cities, provinces or companies up to 100 employees)
3,000+  | Medium Member (e.g. for universities, medium size cities or companies up to 50 employees)
500+    | Small Member (e.g. for smaller cities or companies up to 10 employees)

Membership fees are approved or changed by the QGIS general assembly. They are defined as
minimum fees per category, but may be increased if the sustaining member chooses to do so.

Because QGIS.ORG is a world-wide project and different companies, NGOs or governmental
organizations have different financial prospects, we do not enforce any membership
levels - the organizations pick their own membership level based on self-assessment.

{{< box-start  ribbon="Note!" ribbon-class="is-warning">}}

Acceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board,
who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and
ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.


Sustaining members have no voting rights (unless they
are simultaneously voting members in which case their voting rights are unaffected).
At or above the following levels a sustaining member will be designated as being one
of the following category, based on their size and assigned through self declaration.

## Donation


Donations can be of any amount, via direct transfers to our bank account (SEPA payment),
credit card payment (through stripe.com) or Paypal
(information available at `Donations <https://donate.qgis.org>`__ page).
Even a small donation can make a difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use the
direct transfer (SEPA payment) to our bank account. If you wish to use credit card
payments, payments through stripe.com are preferred as payment fees are lower than
with PayPal. PayPal payments also imply an unnecessary currency conversion (€ to CHF and
back to €) for reasons only PayPal understands.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in some countries (e.g. in Germany through the 
`German QGIS user group <https://www.qgis.de/#spendenkonto>`_).
Please refer to your local tax office for details.

# How will you benefit supporting the QGIS Development?


Supporting the QGIS project as a sustaining member provides the following benefits:

* Ensures the sustainability and health of the QGIS project.
* Helps with fixing bugs and issues
* All sustaining members and donors will be listed on the project :ref:`QGIS-sustaining_members` page,
  ordered by membership category (flagship, large, medium, small) with a 
  link back to the sustaining members organization or company website and the logo
  in a size reflecting their membership category.
* flagship, large and medium sustaining members will have their logo on the QGIS homepage
  footer banner with a logo size and order reflecting their membership category
* sustaining membership logos are listed in the visual changelogs produced for each QGIS
  software release
* sustaining members will be allowed to use a special version of the QGIS logo on their
  web site and promotional materials, which shows they are supporting the
  QGIS project
* No advertising will be placed within the QGIS application itself.

Donors will be listed on the :ref:`QGIS-sustaining_members` page,
but do not receive the additional benefits listed above for sustaining members, except for
the first two items.

Decisions on spending of funds will be made by the QGIS Project Steering Committee,
proposed in a budget that will be approved or declined by the QGIS.ORG general assembly.

.. note:: We regret that we cannot accept 'earmarked' funding as it creates
    many administrative issues. If you are interested in funding specific aspects
    of QGIS development, we encourage you to allocate additional human resources to
    the project, e.g. hiring a developer, or participating to our bug fixing
    initiative.

.. warning:: Acceptance of sustaining membership applications is at the discretion of the QGIS
   PSC. We reserve the right to decline offers of sustaining members if the membership
   organisation or party seems to be at odds with the ethos of our project. For
   example offers from marketing companies that have nothing to do with GIS /
   spatial services, or offers where we have reason to believe the presence of
   the sustaining member logo and marketing materials on our site and other materials will
   degrade the experience of our users will be declined.
