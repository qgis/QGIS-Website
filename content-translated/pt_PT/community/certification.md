## Become a QGIS certified training organisation
Does your organisation participate actively in the QGIS community and offer high-quality training courses with QGIS? Then consider applying for the **QGIS Certification Programme**. As a member, you'll be able to issue the official QGIS certificate to participants of your courses, workshops and training. Each certificate contributes €20 to QGIS.
### Certification Process
#### Requirements
The QGIS Certification Programme is designed to promote both community involvement in the QGIS project and quality education for QGIS software. The application process requires applicants to detail their contributions to the QGIS project and make their training materials available for review. Contributions to the QGIS project include activities such as:
* Desenvolvimento / submissões para o QGIS
* Contribuições para a documentação QGIS e materiais de formação
* Tradução de materiais do QGIS
* Autoria de Plugins
* Preenchimento de relatórios de erros
* Suporte financeiro para o desenvolvimento de uma nova funcionalidade
* Patrocínio e contribuições financeiras para o QGIS
* Envolvimento com o seu Grupo Local de Utilizadores QGIS
* Publicação de acesso aberto de material didático QGIS
* Autoria de livros sobre QGIS

#### Aplicação
Você é obrigado a fornecer o material de formação para cada um dos seus cursos. Isso inclui exercícios, palestras e dados. Este material será avaliado quanto à sua atualidade, representação correta do projecto QGIS e qualidade geral. Se o material não tiver qualidade adequada, isso pode ser motivo de recusa.

Following an initial review, the application will be sent to local [QGIS User Groups](https://qgis.org/community/groups/) for their opinion. This part of the review should be completed within a month. If there is not a local QGIS User Group, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) will make a determination based on material provided and your reputation in the community. In this latter case, you are encouraged to establish a local QGIS User Group. If you are not considered a member in good standing of the QGIS community, this could be a reason for refusal.

The PSC will make the final determination. If accepted as a QGIS Certified Organization, your contributions to the project will be published for transparency.

If approved, you are required to pay a **€20 certification fee** to the QGIS project for each certificate you issue. This creates a mechanism for financial support of the project. Payments for certificates are made either using online credit card transactions or on request by regular invoice and SEPA wire transfer. Payments can be handled in batches for many certificates at once.

You can apply through the [QGIS Certification Programme website](https://certification.qgis.org/).
