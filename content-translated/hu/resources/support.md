## Before you start
Before you head off to join up with your chosen support group, we would like to mention a few guidelines for participating in our community:
### Stay on topic
This forum is for sharing ideas, tools, tutorials, case studies, and questions related only to the use of QGIS (and related tools) in various fields. It is not for discussions about GIS in general or unrelated software (GIS or otherwise).
### Nyelv
As we are a global group, all posts must be in English (unless the group you join is language specific). If you have a post in another language, please provide a translated description.
### Spam
Posts about platforms, products, and services not pertaining to QGIS or not incorporating QGIS as part of a broader offering are not allowed.
### Self-Promotion
Companies or individuals posting products and services about QGIS are welcome (this does not mean endorsement) as long as they contribute meaningfully to the discourse, such as by answering questions. Excessive self-promotion will be considered spam.
### Clarity
Be clear and objective. Try to include screenshots. Show effort by consulting the official QGIS documentation. For example, show that you have already reviewed the documentation, searched Google, asked ChatGPT etc. Mark issues as solved once they are resolved so that people do not spend effort on your problem unnecessarily.
## Discourse
We have recently started a discourse forum for QGIS related support. Over time we expect to move more if our community support activities to this area. The discourse forums are available [on the OSGEO hosted discourse page](https://discourse.osgeo.org/tag/qgis).
## Levelezőlisták
QGIS has various mailing lists for discussing QGIS related topics. See [Mailing lists]({{< ref "community/organisation/mailinglists" >}}).

If you are going to ask questions please read this: [How to ask a QGIS question?](faq/#how-to-ask-a-qgis-question).
## StackExchange
You can ask questions on [GIS StackExchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com). If you use the tag `qgis` you’ll see all QGIS related questions and answers: http://gis.stackexchange.com/?tags=qgis
## Kommunikációs csatornák
### Telegram
There is a vibrant user and community related chat group (english spoken) on the Telegram channel, which you can [join here](https://t.me/joinchat/Aq2V5RPoxYYhXqUPoxRWPQ).

To join: install Telegram on your phone, register and join via the link above.

There is also a web version (https://web.telegram.org) which you can join in the browser (after you have joined telegram via your phone number).
### Matrix / IRC
Matrix (https://matrix.org) is a project for decentralised chat. QGIS has a room which is accessible at the **#qgis:osgeo.org** alias (among others) which bridges to the libera.chat **#qgis** IRC channel.

To use Matrix: create an account (at matrix.org is easiest, but if you have an OSGeo account you can also [use your OSGeo id as matrix id](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Matrix#Connecting_to_the_OSGeo_Matrix_Homeserver)), install a client (Element is easiest, but see https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/#clients for more), or point your browser to https://matrix.to/#/#qgis:osgeo.org.

Az IRC használatához: telepítsen egy IRC-klienst és csatlakozzon az irc://irc.libera.chat/#qgis szobához, vagy nyissa meg böngészőben a https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#qgis címet.

## Felhasználói csoportok
A helyi QGIS felhasználói csoport nagyszerű hely más felhasználókkal találkozásra.
