## Become a QGIS certified training organisation
Does your organisation participate actively in the QGIS community and offer high-quality training courses with QGIS? Then consider applying for the **QGIS Certification Programme**. As a member, you'll be able to issue the official QGIS certificate to participants of your courses, workshops and training. Each certificate contributes €20 to QGIS.
### Certification Process
#### Requirements
The QGIS Certification Programme is designed to promote both community involvement in the QGIS project and quality education for QGIS software. The application process requires applicants to detail their contributions to the QGIS project and make their training materials available for review. Contributions to the QGIS project include activities such as:
* QGIS 開發/提交
* 貢獻 QGIS 說明文件和訓練素材
* 翻譯 QGIS 素材
* 撰寫外掛程式
* 填寫錯誤報告
* 金融贊助新功能開發
* 金融支援和 QGIS 獎助
* QGIS 使用者群組投入程度
* QGIS 課程出版品
* 撰寫 QGIS 書籍

#### 應用設定
你被要求要提供每堂課程的訓練素材，包括練習、講習和資料。這些素材會從 QGIS 專案的即時性、正確性表現，以及整體品質的角度審核。如果素材不夠有品質，也許會因此拒絕。

Following an initial review, the application will be sent to local [QGIS User Groups](https://qgis.org/community/groups/) for their opinion. This part of the review should be completed within a month. If there is not a local QGIS User Group, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) will make a determination based on material provided and your reputation in the community. In this latter case, you are encouraged to establish a local QGIS User Group. If you are not considered a member in good standing of the QGIS community, this could be a reason for refusal.

The PSC will make the final determination. If accepted as a QGIS Certified Organization, your contributions to the project will be published for transparency.

If approved, you are required to pay a **€20 certification fee** to the QGIS project for each certificate you issue. This creates a mechanism for financial support of the project. Payments for certificates are made either using online credit card transactions or on request by regular invoice and SEPA wire transfer. Payments can be handled in batches for many certificates at once.

You can apply through the [QGIS Certification Programme website](https://certification.qgis.org/).
