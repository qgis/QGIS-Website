## Become a QGIS certified training organisation
Does your organisation participate actively in the QGIS community and offer high-quality training courses with QGIS? Then consider applying for the **QGIS Certification Programme**. As a member, you'll be able to issue the official QGIS certificate to participants of your courses, workshops and training. Each certificate contributes €20 to QGIS.
### 証明プロセス
#### Requirements
The QGIS Certification Programme is designed to promote both community involvement in the QGIS project and quality education for QGIS software. The application process requires applicants to detail their contributions to the QGIS project and make their training materials available for review. Contributions to the QGIS project include activities such as:
* 開発/ QGISへのコミット
* QGISドキュメンテーションとトレーニング教材への貢献
* QGIS資料の翻訳
* オーサリングプラグイン
* バグ報告の提出
* 新機能開発を財政的に支援する
* QGISへの寄付と後援
* 地元のQGISユーザーグループへの参加
* 公開QGISコースウェアの公開
* QGIS書籍の著述

#### 申請
各コースのトレーニング教材を提供する必要があります。これには演習、講義、データが含まれます。この資料は、最新性、QGISプロジェクトの正確な表現、および全体的な品質についてレビューされます。教材の品質が十分でない場合は、これが拒否の原因になる可能性があります。

Following an initial review, the application will be sent to local [QGIS User Groups](https://qgis.org/community/groups/) for their opinion. This part of the review should be completed within a month. If there is not a local QGIS User Group, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) will make a determination based on material provided and your reputation in the community. In this latter case, you are encouraged to establish a local QGIS User Group. If you are not considered a member in good standing of the QGIS community, this could be a reason for refusal.

The PSC will make the final determination. If accepted as a QGIS Certified Organization, your contributions to the project will be published for transparency.

If approved, you are required to pay a **€20 certification fee** to the QGIS project for each certificate you issue. This creates a mechanism for financial support of the project. Payments for certificates are made either using online credit card transactions or on request by regular invoice and SEPA wire transfer. Payments can be handled in batches for many certificates at once.

You can apply through the [QGIS Certification Programme website](https://certification.qgis.org/).
