description: "To create the map, I've used the TopoTijdReis plugin in QGIS to explore\
  \ some beautiful historic maps. I then sampled fill and line colours and patterns\
  \ from a topographic map of 1948. Using the OpenStreetMap vector tile from MapTiler\
  \ via the MapTiler plugin, I adjusted the colours of features with the samples using\
  \ Symbol layer types Raster Image Fill, Raster Line and Raster Image Marker. Because\
  \ a vector tile layer was used, I can create this map style for any place on earth\
  \ with enough OpenStreetMap data!\r\nThe TopoTijdReis plugin is an amazing tool\
  \ that lets you travel through time with historic topographic maps of the Netherlands\
  \ in QGIS!"
