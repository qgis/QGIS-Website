## Become a QGIS certified training organisation
Does your organisation participate actively in the QGIS community and offer high-quality training courses with QGIS? Then consider applying for the **QGIS Certification Programme**. As a member, you'll be able to issue the official QGIS certificate to participants of your courses, workshops and training. Each certificate contributes €20 to QGIS.
### Processus de certification
#### Requirements
The QGIS Certification Programme is designed to promote both community involvement in the QGIS project and quality education for QGIS software. The application process requires applicants to detail their contributions to the QGIS project and make their training materials available for review. Contributions to the QGIS project include activities such as:
* Développement/commits dans QGIS
* Contributions à la documentation et au matériel de formation QGIS
* Traduction pour le projet QGIS
* Développement d'extensions
* Déclaration d'anomalies
* Support financier pour le développement de nouvelles fonctionnalités
* Contributions financières et sponsoring auprès de QGIS
* Implication dans un groupe d'utilisateur local
* Publication de tutoriels QGIS
* Publication de livres sur QGIS

#### Application
Il vous est demandé de fournir le matériel pédagogique utilisé dans vos formations, incluant les cours, exercices et données. Ce matériel sera évalué au regard de son actualité, de sa qualité globale et de l'image qu'il renvoie du projet QGIS. Un matériel d'une qualité inadéquate peut être un motif de refus

Following an initial review, the application will be sent to local [QGIS User Groups](https://qgis.org/community/groups/) for their opinion. This part of the review should be completed within a month. If there is not a local QGIS User Group, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) will make a determination based on material provided and your reputation in the community. In this latter case, you are encouraged to establish a local QGIS User Group. If you are not considered a member in good standing of the QGIS community, this could be a reason for refusal.

The PSC will make the final determination. If accepted as a QGIS Certified Organization, your contributions to the project will be published for transparency.

If approved, you are required to pay a **€20 certification fee** to the QGIS project for each certificate you issue. This creates a mechanism for financial support of the project. Payments for certificates are made either using online credit card transactions or on request by regular invoice and SEPA wire transfer. Payments can be handled in batches for many certificates at once.

You can apply through the [QGIS Certification Programme website](https://certification.qgis.org/).
