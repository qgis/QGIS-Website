# Résumé
QGIS is a high impact, global project. QGIS.org provides open access to best-in-class tools for visualising, creating, editing, analysing and publication of spatially linked data and information products. QGIS.org does not prescribe how these tools should be used, but we make these tools freely available and accessible to everyone in order to foster a more just society, the making of better decisions and further the goal of a more sustainable environment. We provide tools for working on traditional desktop PC’s, on mobile devices and in the cloud.

## Qui utilise QGIS ?
QGIS est utilisé par les gouvernements, les grandes multinationales, les entreprises, les établissements d'enseignement, ainsi que par les petites entreprises et les amateurs. Notre modèle de développement open source rend le logiciel accessible à tous ces utilisateurs à un coût abordable, permettant ainsi à chacun de profiter des avantages de QGIS.

## QGIS est gratuit, mais pas sans frais.
It has taken, and will continue to take, a great deal of effort to develop high quality tools like those provided at QGIS.org. Initially this cost was borne exclusively through the efforts of dedicated volunteers. As the project matured, a financial ecosystem developed around the project. Customers began to contract community members to extend the QGIS project (software, documentation, online infrastructure) to better serve their needs.

Parallèlement à ces efforts de financement ciblés, nous avons mis en place des programmes de soutien au projet grâce à des fonds que nous pouvons utiliser à notre discrétion, via des dons et des adhésions régulières. Ces fonds discrétionnaires nous permettent de fournir l'ensemble de l'infrastructure nécessaire au projet. Ils nous permettent également de financer :
- améliorations qualitatives au logiciel
- host developer meetings
- recruter des contributeurs techniques pour améliorer les aspects à grande échelle du projet, et
- développer la communauté autour du projet afin de renforcer sa viabilité à long terme.

## A value for value model
Many of our users migrate to QGIS from proprietary alternatives which are financially unsustainable to use within their organisations. We celebrate the fact that we are able to open doors for those needing spatial tools such as QGIS which would have otherwise been closed. However, we also ask you to share some of the value gains that you realise from moving to QGIS with us. The funds you provide to us are used to the direct benefit of all users, who get to enjoy a more feature rich, stable and well documented set of QGIS tools. This ‘value for value’ model helps to ensure the long term sustainability and prosperity of the QGIS project. With nearly half a million daily active users, your contributions can make a huge impact to the lives of many people. The project has received in-kind and financial contributions from many well known international organisations around the world, whom we thank deeply. We invite you to join the ever growing number of organisations who see value in the work we do and share value back to us in the form of financial contributions to support our work.

## Gouvernance
QGIS.org is registered as a Swiss Verrein (Association) that is operated in a non-profit manner. It is managed by an elected board and contributed to by hundreds of people from around the world. In the same way that the software we develop is open source, the project is operated with the same principle of openness, with all financial reports, board reports and community decisions carried out in an open and transparent way.
