## Before download starts
Our software is, and always will be, available free of charge if downloaded from QGIS.org.

The project is a result of a huge effort and social contribution from many community members who volunteer their time and expertise. In addition, many businesses, government agencies and commercial entities have contributed to the development of QGIS. They do this either to ensure that QGIS meets their specific needs or to contribute to and accelerate the huge social impact that is realised by making a tool such as QGIS freely available. Our goal is the betterment of society through informed spatial decision making. If you are able, we gently request that you support our work.

Whether you choose to donate or not, we hope that you enjoy using our labour of love and encourage you to share and spread your downloaded copy far and wide so that others may enjoy it too.

Our very best regards!

Note: There are no QGIS 3.40 LTR builds available on macOS. QGIS 3.44 is stable and has been designated as the future Long Term Release (LTR); therefore 3.44 is the recommended version for macOS users.

Alternatively, it is also possible to install QGIS via MacPorts, see the [MacPorts Installing Instructions]({{< ref "resources/installation-guide/#macports" >}})
