"To create the map, I've used the TopoTijdReis plugin in QGIS to explore some beautiful historic maps. I then sampled fill and line colours and patterns from a topographic map of 1948. Using the OpenStreetMap vector tile from MapTiler via the MapTiler plugin, I adjusted the colours of features with the samples using Symbol layer types Raster Image Fill, Raster Line and Raster Image Marker. Because a vector tile layer was used, I can create this map style for any place on earth with enough OpenStreetMap data!\r\n"
