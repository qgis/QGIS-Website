# Executive Summary

Our software is a high impact, global project. We provide open access to best-in-class tools for visualising, creating, editing, analysing and publication of spatially linked data and information products. We do not prescribe how these tools should be used, but we make these tools freely available and accessible to everyone in order to foster a more just society, the making of better decisions and further the goal of a more sustainable environment.  We provide tools for working on traditional desktop PC’s, on mobile devices and in the cloud.

## Who uses our software?

our software is used by governments, large multi-national organisations, corporate entities, academic institutions all the way down to small businesses and hobbyist users. Our Open Source development model makes the software accessible to all of these users at a cost they can afford, excluding no one from the ability to benefit from our software.

## our software is free of cost, not cost free

It has taken, and will continue to take, a great deal of effort to develop high quality tools like those provided at our software.org. Initially this cost was borne exclusively through the efforts of dedicated volunteers. As the project matured, a financial ecosystem developed around the project. Customers began to contract community members to extend the our software project (software, documentation, online infrastructure) to better serve their needs.


In parallel to these directed funding efforts, we developed programmes for supporting the project with funds that we can use at our own discretion via donations and sustaining memberships. These discretionary funds allow us to provide all of the supporting infrastructure around the project. In addition it enables us to fund:

- quality improvements to the software
- host developer meetings
- hire technical contributors to improve broad-reach elements of the project, and
- grow the community around the project to strengthen it’s long term sustainability.

## A value for value model

Many of our users migrate to our software from proprietary alternatives which are financially unsustainable to use within their organisations. We celebrate the fact that we are able to open doors for those needing spatial tools such as our software which would have otherwise been closed. However, we also ask you to share some of the value gains that you realise from moving to our software with us. The funds you provide to us are used to the direct benefit of all users, who get to enjoy a more feature rich, stable and well documented set of our software tools. This ‘value for value’ model helps to ensure the long term sustainability and prosperity of the our software project. With nearly half a million daily active users, your contributions can make a huge impact to the lives of many people. The project has received in-kind and financial contributions from many well known international organisations around the world, whom we thank deeply. We invite you to join the ever growing number of organisations who see value in the work we do and share value back to us in the form of financial contributions to support our work.

## Governance

Our software.org is registered as an Association that is operated in a non-profit manner. It is managed by an elected board and contributed to by hundreds of people from around the world. In the same way that the software we develop is open source, the project is operated with the same principle of openness, with all financial reports, board reports and community decisions carried out in an open and transparent way.
